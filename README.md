CMPM130 S01 Assignment

Using Github Codespaces, I changed the code in my assignment so that whenever you click the button the counter variable (not the counter on screen) goes up by 25. I also used github actions to automate the publishing of the site to pages.
The workflow will automatically publish any updates to the site at `https://joshuwoshua1.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-JoshuaKimPearson/`
